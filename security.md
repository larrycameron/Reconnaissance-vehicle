# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and protocols implemented in the Autonomous Robot Control System. Security is a critical aspect of the system, ensuring safe operation and protection against unauthorized access.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### API Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt

#### Access Levels
- Admin: Full system control
- Operator: Basic control and monitoring
- Viewer: Read-only access
- System: Internal service access

### 2. Network Security

#### Communication Protocols
- HTTPS for all web communications
- TLS 1.3 for secure data transmission
- WebSocket with WSS for real-time updates
- MQTT with TLS for IoT communications

#### Firewall Rules
- Port restrictions
- IP whitelisting
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection

### 3. Data Security

#### Data Encryption
- AES-256 for data at rest
- TLS for data in transit
- Secure key management
- Regular key rotation

#### Data Protection
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### 4. System Security

#### Physical Security
- Secure boot process
- Hardware security modules (HSM)
- Tamper detection
- Emergency shutdown protocols

#### Software Security
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Code signing
- Secure coding practices

## Security Protocols

### 1. Emergency Procedures

#### System Shutdown
1. Immediate power cutoff
2. Save critical data
3. Log shutdown event
4. Notify administrators

#### Unauthorized Access
1. Block access attempt
2. Log security event
3. Alert security team
4. Initiate investigation

### 2. Access Control

#### User Authentication
```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Verify credentials
    # Generate JWT token
    # Set access permissions
    pass

def verify_token(token):
    # Validate JWT token
    # Check expiration
    # Verify signature
    pass
```

#### Permission Management
```python
def check_permissions(user, action):
    # Verify user role
    # Check action permissions
    # Log access attempt
    pass
```

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption
```python
def encrypt_data(data):
    # Generate encryption key
    # Encrypt data
    # Store encrypted data
    pass

def decrypt_data(encrypted_data):
    # Retrieve encryption key
    # Decrypt data
    # Validate decrypted data
    pass
```
